# printf
This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

**Subject:**

Constraints are as follows:
- The prototype of ft_printf should be **int ft_printf(const char *, ...)**;
- You have to recode the libc's printf function
- It must not do the buffer management like the real prinft
- It will manage the following conversions: cspiuxX%
- It will manage any combination of the following flags: ;-0.'* and a minimum field width with all conversions
- It will be compared with the real printf

**Usage:**
